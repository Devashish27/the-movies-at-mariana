=# The Movies@Mariana

## Project Description

Mariana Tek is hosting a series of events called The Movies@Mariana this summer for camaraderie purposes. This project aims to create a small application that allows users to view the movies on the schedule, separated by date. The application provides filtering by genre and searching by title. It also includes movie information such as title, poster, genre, rating, year of release, Metacritic rating, and runtime.
