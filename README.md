# Mariana At the Movies

## Prompt

Mariana Tek is hosting a series called The Movies@Mariana Tek events this summer for camaraderie purposes. We want to be as democratic as possible, so each night we will have 3 choices that we can vote on. We want to create a small application where everyone can view the movies on a schedule, separated by date. These movies should be shown in a list with the following information:

- Title
- Poster
- Genre(s)
- Rating
- Year Release
- Metacritic Rating
- Runtime

There should be one filter and one search. The first is a Filter By Genre. This filter should be a dropdown list, populated with all genres of movies currently in our list.

The search should be by Title. It's should be a text input that with each character shows each movie that matches and hides each movie that doesn't.
